# public-discord-bot
A public Discord bot that I will be coding.

I'm very familiar with coding in `discord.js`, just the fact that most of the programming which has been centred around a Discord bot I've been making for the past year is private... so yeah. In this repository, I aim to expose my knowledge of programming in `discord.js` to the wider community :D
